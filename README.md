Oceans Gromits – Video link with interactive/reactive elements 

As part of the ‘Gromit Unleashed 2’ sculpture trail, the University created four interactive sculptures. Two of these - ‘Oceans 1: Deep Blue’ and ‘Oceans 2: Yellow Sub’ - used a video link, which allowed visitors to We the Curious and MShed to view each other across the harbour. The University reacquired these sculptures at the close of the trail, and wishes to place one in MVB, and the other at the new Temple Quarter precinct. 

The sculptures should show the feed from the others camera. This should be done in the most robust, and lowest maintenance way possible.
