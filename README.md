## Background

As part of the ‘Gromit Unleashed 2’ sculpture trail, the University created
four interactive sculptures. Two of these - ‘Oceans 1: Deep Blue’ and 
‘Oceans 2: Yellow Sub’ - used a video link, which allowed visitors to We the
Curious and MShed to view each other across the harbour. The University 
reacquired these sculptures at the close of the trail, and wishes to place 
one in MVB, and the other at the new Temple Quarter precinct. 

The sculptures should show the feed from the others camera. 
This should be done in the most robust, and lowest maintenance way possible.

## Firmware

Our firmware is a local web server based on the Java Spring framework.
This will host a JavaScript application that will display the video feed from
other Gromits and broadcast a video feed from the Gromits own webcam.
